# Fridgester
## Motivation:
I have always loved to cook. Eating delicious and healthy food has always been important to me. Sometimes after a long day of work, its can be hard to think about what I want to eat. I have just enough energy to go to the store and buy groceries and whip up a quick meal. I want a quick and easy way to take stock of what ingredients I have in my fridge, so as I run out to the store I can look up recipes online and create a fast shopping list for the missing ingredients. This project is a refactor of my unit one software engineering immersive project. You can find the original project here. https://github.com/dscription/api-recipe-project
